Pure quantum states are at odds with the concepts of statistical mechanics as they completely isolated from the environment, therefore, preserve their purity even if the system's parameters are suddenly altered. However, in the wide class of systems coherent many-body dynamic dives local thermalization of the subsystem. In this case, any local observable appears thermal and can be described by the statistical ensemble, even though the full state remains pure. The key to understanding the phenomenon of quantum thermalization lies in the entanglement properties of the system: The presence of entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics.

In this thesis, we experimentally study the emergence of statistical mechanics in a quantum state and observe the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in facilitating this emergence. We perform microscopy on an evolving quantum system, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that the full quantum state remains pure.

The only known robust exception from the paradigm of quantum thermalization is provided by disordered systems. In this case, the particle transport ceases through the system, preventing the formation of sufficient amount of entanglement required for thermalization. However, if the many-body system is interacting, the state develops non-local quantum correlations, that are inaccessible to any local observable. These correlations spread exponentially slow in time throughout the entire system and are considered a hallmark feature of many-body-localized states.

We experimentally realize such many-body localized system and observe the formation of non-local quantum correlations, while the particle transport is frozen in the system. Our work experimentally establishes many-body localization as a qualitatively distinct phenomenon from localization in non-interacting, disordered systems.

In order to study the interplay between thermalization and localization in our system, we develop novel methods for high fidelity state preparation and readout. We achieved an exquisite isolation of our system from the environment, that allows us to monitor coherent many-body dynamics over multiple decades of time evolution. This makes our system the most advanced special prepuce quantum simulator up to data.
